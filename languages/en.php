After the distribution of masks and hydro-alcoholic solutions this Monday, May 11 and the dissemination of health instructions the previous week, the University of Strasbourg will be accessible from May 12 to certain staff only. It is a matter of priority to enforce the national instructions, to accompany all the actors of the university in this delicate period, and to stimulate a progressive resumption of all the possible activities. <br>

If teleworking will continue for a large part of the agents, research activities in direct link with the CNRS and Inserm, certain administrative activities, the management of buildings and sites will resume face-to-face according to a strict protocol respecting sanitary measures and barrier gestures. These guidelines apply to all university staff, whatever their missions, professions, status. The University of Strasbourg remains attentive to any individual situation and in particular to staff who have been isolated. As for the students, they will continue their teaching at a distance, as will the assessments, the new methods of which have recently been validated by the Commission Formation et Vie Universitaire (CFVU). </p>",

“Some patients with COVID-19 present around the 8th day a severe form of the disease, a severe respiratory attack responsible for almost all current stays in intensive care. Our goal is to better understand this late worsening in order to better anticipate and manage it. »Specifies Professor Olivier Epaulard, infectious disease specialist at CHU Grenoble Alpes, who is co-leading the project with Dr Audrey Le Gouellec and Professor Bertrand Toussaint, both medical biologists at CHUGA and researchers in the TIMC-IMAG laboratory (CNRS / UGA / Grenoble INP-UGA).</p>",

One of the latter's objectives is to help double the number of doctors trained in artificial intelligence. In connection with this objective, the ANR launched in 2019 a call for programs 'Doctoral Contracts in Artificial Intelligence - Establishment' for which the University of Lille and the Inria center of Lille have submitted a program, AI_PhD @ Lille. The results, recently announced, attribute 22 thesis co-financings to them.</p>",
